LAHAINA, Hawaii - Bryant Crawford's driving layup with 3.2 seconds to play gave Wake Forest the lead and the Demon Deacons beat No. 13 Indiana 82-78 on Monday in the opening round of the Maui Jim Maui Invitational.

Wake Forest had at least a plus-10 rebound advantage in its first four games, the first time it had done that since the first six games of 1997-98 when Tim Duncan was at center.

Wake Forest will play its final game in Maui in the Third Place game tomorrow night at 7:30, taking on the loser of the Kansas-UCLA game.

Wade Baldwin IV added 17 points of his own and some heady play at point guard, while Jeff Roberson came off the bench to chip in 12 points of his own.

A 7-0 Wake run with leading scorer Devin Thomas on the bench trimmed the Commodores' advantage to 14 with just over 12 minutes remaining, but a few timely Vanderbilt jump shots held the Demon Deacons off as the lead settled in around the low twenties.
